## About
Laravel Environment is a library designed to be used in conjunction with Laravel. It enables the user to **load a different .env file from the original**. The coolest thing about this library is that it **provides different methods** for you to do this.

There are currently 3 methods:
```php
\Ejetar\LaravelEnvironment::fromSystemEnvironmentVariable($system_environment_variable_name, $default_value = 'local')
//Loads an environment file according to the value of a system environment variable
```
```php
\Ejetar\LaravelEnvironment::fromFile($filename)
//Loads an environment file explicitly, stating the file path
```
```php
\Ejetar\LaravelEnvironment::fromCustomMethod(Callable $callable)
//Enables the user to enter a custom method for loading the environment file
```

## How it works
To use this library is very simple, just call Laravel Environment before `return $app;` in the `bootstrap/app.php` file:
```php
...

\Ejetar\LaravelEnvironment\LaravelEnvironment::fromSystemEnvironmentVariable('MYAPP_ENV');

return $app;
```

## Get started
### Examples
#### From system environment variable method
##### First example
We assume in this example that the system environment variable MYAPP_ENV exists and has the value 'production'.
```php
\Ejetar\LaravelEnvironment\LaravelEnvironment::fromSystemEnvironmentVariable('MYAPP_ENV');
//Will load the environment file .env.production
```
##### Second example
We assume in this example that the system environment variable MYAPP_ENV does not exist.
```php
\Ejetar\LaravelEnvironment\LaravelEnvironment::fromSystemEnvironmentVariable('MYAPP_ENV');
//Will load the .env.local environment file. When the system environment variable does not exist, then it takes $default_value.
//By default $default_value is set to 'local'.
```
##### Third example
We assume in this example that the system environment variable MYAPP_ENV does not exist, and $default_value will be 'acme'.
```php
\Ejetar\LaravelEnvironment\LaravelEnvironment::fromSystemEnvironmentVariable('MYAPP_ENV', 'acme');
//Will load the .env.acme environment file. When the system environment variable does not exist, then it takes $default_value.
```

#### From file method
##### First example
```php
\Ejetar\LaravelEnvironment::fromFile('.env.local');
//Load the .env.local file explicitly
```

#### From custom method
##### First example
Loading the server IP-based environment file:
```php
\Ejetar\LaravelEnvironment::fromCustomMethod(function(){
  switch($_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR']) {
    case '1.2.3.4':
      return '.env.local';
      break;
    case '5.6.7.8':
      return '.env.production';
      break;
    default: 
      return '.env.other';
  }
});
```
